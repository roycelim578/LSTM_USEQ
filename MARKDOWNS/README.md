## Abstract

This study examined the viability of using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the short-term price movements of 50 large-cap US equities and design a leveraged trading strategy based on these predictions. By focusing on five high-volatility GICS sectors, a rich feature set combining price momentum, earnings data, and macroeconomic indicators was processed and fed into the LSTM models. The models demonstrated consistent performance, achieving an overall precision of 73.52% for 'buy' signals across folds.

The backtested trading strategy, leveraging the predictive outputs of these models, significantly outperformed the SPY benchmark by achieving an average annualized return of 44.55% over five 20-month periods â€” more than threefold that of the benchmark, which stood at 13.78%. Moreover, key financial metrics such as the Sharpe ratio (0.91 vs. 0.79), Sortino Ratio (1.41 vs 0.99) and information ratio (0.69) indicated superior risk-adjusted returns and consistent outperformance. However, the strategy exhibited heightened sensitivity to market fluctuations, with a beta of 1.2788 and a maximum drawdown of -33.68%, which aligned with expectations given the inherent risks of leveraged trading.

Several potential extensions were discussed, including broadening stock and feature selection, incorporating dynamic parameters, generating synthetic data, and adopting options-based strategies. If implemented correctly, these strategies can enhance the efficacy of LSTM-based trading strategies by improving predictive power, capturing greater alpha and limiting downside risks.

In summary, the results of this study suggest that LSTM models, when combined with a well-structured trading strategy, can serve as an effective tool for generating significant alpha in equity markets. However, given the elevated risks associated with leverage and the dynamic nature of financial markets, further work is needed to enhance model robustness and risk management, particularly in volatile or uncertain market environments.
